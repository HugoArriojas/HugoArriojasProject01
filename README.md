# Delicious PSD Conversion

This was one of the first PSD conversions that I was responsible for at Juno College.

The goal for this project was to make a multi-page site from 3 PSD files and create our own mobile site from the design given.
From here, I decided to add functionality to the comment section on the blog page.

Future function(s) that I want to implement:
- Adding firebase integration for the comment section for more permanent comments

Fixes to make:
- Extra margins on some sections in order to increase readability
